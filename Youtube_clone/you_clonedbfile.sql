xum35-XplNY	What Is the Point of Spirituality?	A lot of people are - rightly - very sceptical of what goes on under the word 'spirituality.' But might there be something of value nevertheless in aspects of what people call the spiritual? A short guide to what a highly rational mind might learn to appreciate within the concept of 'the spiritual.'\n\nEnjoying our Youtube videos?

For some, it’s an innately beautiful touchstone, the designator of a special kind of experience that is so valuable, it is best left reverentially unexplored and pure, lest one disturb its ethereal mysteries with the cold hand of reason. For others, it’s nonsensical bunkum of appeal only to adolescent dreamers, the underemployed and the weak minded. But precisely because ‘spiritual experiences’ are so often either worshiped or derided, it pays to try to submit them to dispassionate and sober examination, not in order a priori to crush them or honour them, but so as to make them more intelligible, to friend and foe alike. Whatever our suspicions, spiritual moments are capable of being pinned down, split into their constituent elements and assessed with due regard. One should – and can – get respectfully rational about spirituality.”\n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE\n\nWatch more films on SELF in our playlist: \nhttp://bit.ly/TSOLself\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFeel free to follow us at the links below:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/  \n\nX: https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife   \n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/ \n\nCREDITS\n\nProduced in collaboration with:\n \nNatalia Biegaj\nhttps://www.nb-animation.com/\n\nTitle animation produced in collaboration with\n\nVale Productions\nhttps://www.valeproductions.co.uk/	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xum35-XplNY	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xum35-XplNY/hqdefault.jpg	youtube	scraped	UC7IcJI8PUf5Z3zKxnZvTBog	The School of Life	2019-05-08 18:30:11	551283	16174	the school of life, schooloflife, education, relationships, alain de botton, philosophy, talk, self, improvement, big questions, love, wellness, mindfullness, psychology, how, to, hack, spirituality, meaning, spirituality vs religion, spirituality for beginners, PL-SELF, being spiritual not religious, being spiritual, faith, non religious faith, religious debate, spiritual debate, crisis	496	t

lWePaMgaVZg	What Is Spirituality? - The BEST Explanation You Need To Hear	These are the best and the most comprehensive explanations about what is spirituality and which will clarify this aspect once and for all.\n\nNow, because spirituality doesn’t really have a specific definition, it can actually be defined in many ways. This is probably one of the reasons why this has become such a controversial topic. I’ve personally met quite a few people who associated this term with new-age hippies, cults, religions, belief systems, dogmas, or other traditions around the world. Well, surprise, surprise, spirituality is none of that! In fact, it is the exact opposite of that as you shall discover in just a moment. \rOne of the best and probably the most comprehensive ways of describing spirituality I came across is by defining it as the process of making the mind free from fears, worries and non-stop thinking, and experiencing inner peace and bliss in one’s everyday life. In a way, spirituality is about making peace with the Universe, it is about accepting the facts as they are, and trying to live in harmony. Spirituality is about training yourself to be less reactive to the events happening in your life by freeing yourself from the monkey mind. \nBut of course, that is not all. In fact, spirituality can also be referred to as metaphysics, philosophy, mysticism, and so forth. Besides that, spirituality is the process of awakening from ordinary consciousness, rising above the ego, and awakening to a wider consciousness. It can mean expanding the mind beyond its limitations, thoughts, and limited viewpoints about life and the Universe.\n\n📢🔔 Subscribe, Like, and Comment ➤ https://www.youtube.com/c/EvolvedTeachings\n\nWhat Is Non-Duality? - The Most SHOCKING Truth You Never Heard Of\nhttps://youtu.be/7q5VVLM5Jw4\n\nHow To Know If You Are Having A Spiritual Awakening Experience?\nhttps://youtu.be/8CibfMzw9vc\n\nDrugs and Spiritual Awakening - Experiencing Ego Death On Psychedelics (Acid/Mushrooms/5-MEO-DMT)\nhttps://youtu.be/Qcc-ZKyPZDw\n\nWhat Is A Spiritual Life Coach? + FREE Life Coaching Session\nhttps://youtu.be/zJvxOm6VJ8w\n\nWhat Is A Psychic? - Understanding The Nature Of Psychics And Their Psychic Abilities\nhttps://youtu.be/wPwVQI4wauE\n\nWhy Is Life Hard? - A Motivational Speech About Life\nhttps://youtu.be/9okoCOiZuPU\n\nMarijuana And Spirituality - How To Use Pot/Weed For Spiritual Growth\nhttps://youtu.be/OjLif0eDIJ4\n\nWhat Is Happiness? - The Key To A Happy Life\nhttps://youtu.be/FYwZGmGEhQU\n\nThe Importance of Education - What's The Real Purpose of Education?\nhttps://youtu.be/ZDAdi6ZLktc\n\nHow To Meditate + 3 Meditation Techniques\nhttps://youtu.be/Dzl22iFpqGA\n\nPersonality Development - A Complete Guide\nhttps://youtu.be/2WF2npErPOM\n\nLife Is The Best Teacher - Get Real Life Results\nhttps://youtu.be/b5XyoYdjzPE\n\n\nFollow us on Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/evolved_teachings\n\nVisit our website:\nhttps://www.evolvedteachings.com\n\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: We do not take any responsibility and we are not liable for any damages caused by applying the information provided.

0uYnj1i1EQw	Personal finance: How to save, spend, and think rationally about money | Big Think	Personal finance: How to save, spend, and think rationally about money | Big Think\nWatch the newest video from Big Think: https://bigth.ink/NewVideo\nLearn skills from the world's top minds at Big Think Edge: https://bigth.ink/Edge\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nWhether you have a lot of money or a lot of debt, it matters how you handle your personal finances. A crucial step when it comes to saving is to reassess your relationship with money and to learn to adopt a broader, more logical point of view.\n\nIn this video, social innovator and activist Vicki Robin, psychologist Daniel Kahneman, Harvard Business School professor Michael Norton, and author Bruce Feiler offer advice on achieving financial independence, learning to control your emotions, spending smarter, and teaching children about money.\n\nIt all starts with education and understanding. The more you know about how money works, the better you will be at avoiding mistakes and the easier it will be to take control of your financial circumstances.\n\nCheck Vicki Robin's latest book Your Money or Your Life: 9 Steps to Transforming Your Relationship with Money and Achieving Financial Independence at https://amzn.to/3iYISI8\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nTRANSCRIPT: \n\nVICKI ROBIN: I was leading a session on a relationship with money. I just was curious about where people were with this at this point. This was in 2016. We had 50 people in the room. We circled up and we went around the room, just say something about your relationship with money. And I realized every person in that room was in fear about money. From the 80 year old who I know has millions of dollars to the 20 year old who's like already $20,000 in debt. And it just, honestly it infuriated me like what kind of society requires that everybody participate in something that terrifies them. This feels so amiss to me.\n\nDANIEL KAHNEMAN: People are not fully rational and they make many choices that if they reflected upon them they would do differently. There's no question about that. The major tendency is people tend to frame things very narrowly. They take a narrow view of decision making. They look at the problem at hand and they deal with it as if it were the only problem. Very frequently it's a better idea to look at problems as they will recur throughout your life and then you look at the policy that you're to adopt for a class of problems. Difficult to do would be a better thing. People frame things narrowly in the sense, for example, that they will save and borrow at the same time instead of somehow treating their whole portfolio of assets as one thing. If people were able to take a broader view they would in general make better decisions. So that is certainly one of the weaknesses of human decision making. We call it narrow framing.\n\nFour layers of financial independence\n\nROBIN: First of all, I'd like to distinguish between independence and freedom. So, financial freedom is like freeing your mind. Financial freedom is understanding that I'm me and there's an economy out there and I have a relationship with it but it doesn't run my life. It's freeing my mind from the messages of the consumer culture, the messages of the economy. The messages that a house is a starter house. No, that's my house. I could die in my house. It's like there's so many presumptions that drive us into waste slavery, debt, and it doesn't matter whether you are at the low end or the high end. If you are engaged in that sort of anxious process of more, more, more, you are not free.\n\nSo the first layer of financial independence I talk about is this freedom of the mind. This freeing your mind. Of saying like I am sovereign. The economy is secondary. I will move my sovereign self into the economy for my own purposes rather than I am a schlump, the economy is my mega-boss and I don't know, my boss seems to be as big as the sky and so I will just let my life be run by my boss and the tax system and I'm just going to let myself be run by this thing. No. So you are sovereign beings so that's your first layer of financial independence is your own sovereignty. And then the second layer is to get out of debt. And for some people debt feels endless. And the first step to getting out of debt is stop going into debt. There's many people who have written to us who flatten their debt in a couple of years. Impossible debt. Debt that was going to be endless. They would die with this debt. And once they see what the debt is doing to them in terms of the actual opportunities, the future opportunities of their lives, that's the sort of link that we try to get people to make so that something in the future is more important than the immediate pleasure of buying one more tchotchke that you're never going to use...\n\nRead the full transcript at https://bigthink.com/videos/personal-finance-how-to-save	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uYnj1i1EQw	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0uYnj1i1EQw/hqdefault.jpg	youtube	scraped	UCvQECJukTDE2i6aCoMnS-Vg	Big Think	2020-09-23 14:30:01	2765957	76286	Big Think, BigThink, Education, Educational Videos, Videos, Faster smarter, personal finance, personal finance management, personal finance budgeting and planning, vicki robin your money or your life, vicki robin, daniel kahneman, daniel kahneman big think, daniel kahneman interview, daniel kahneman investing, daniel kahneman money and happiness, financial independence, financial independence retire early, michael norton, michael norton how to buy happiness, bruce feiler	873	t

Too many systems are designed to make you look busy rather than actually get work done and aren't designed for the adhd brain. It's even worse for people with ADHD. These systems were designed for neurotypical brains. They simply don't work. Learn strategies designed for the adhd brain and learn how to motivate your interest-based mind, rather than simply "trying harder" at strategies not designed with you in mind.\n\nAbout:\nIn this video Nik goes over how to beat procrastination, executive paralysis, low motivation and focus, and what he learned after 26 years of having adhd. He hopes this video was able to boost your dopamine. \n\nDisclaimer: All my content is based on my own experience and/or research/observations from licensed professionals.

hoKDrFyQDy0	Versace Spring-Summer 2023 Women’s | Fashion Show | Versace	“I have always loved a rebel. A woman who is confident, smart and a little bit of a diva. She wears leather, studs and frayed denim and she has enough attitude to mix them with chiffon, jersey, and a tiara! She is a strong liberated woman; she is gorgeous; she knows it. She is the Goddess of Freedom.” — Donatella Versace\n \nA dark gothic goddess. That's the woman in mind this season. Black, purple, and hints of fuchsia are the colors running through the whole collection, coming together in looks both high-glamour and hard-edged, diva and subversive.\n \nSingular slashes cut across dresses and tops, while a series of precision cuts come together as graphic pattern details. Tough leather becomes fringing across biker jackets, leather pants and skirts. Jackets are worn over cascading chiffon dresses and skirts with macramé flourishes, creating a clash of structured and fluid forms, composure and impulsion. Slinky silhouette-enhancing dresses are finished in shiny metallic jersey. Shaggy, fur-like coats and miniskirts are crafted from upcycled production off-cut chiffon and lace in an environmentally responsible approach. Metal studs are full-on, covering leather pants and jackets, and piercing through delicate lace in a play with material contrast.\n \nPrints have a brooding glow in the collection’s colors of dark orchid purple and tropical pink. The multi-logo ‘Versace on Repeat’ print, and floral and zebra patterns interplay and are incorporated into laminated lace, fil coupé, intarsia, or metal stud finishes.\n \nBags in the La Medusa line, including La Medusa Repeat, the re-edition hobo bag style introduced for Resort 2023, take-on the collection’s stud, leather fringe, and mirror material finishes, while the classical elegance of the Greca Goddess bag is made utterly contemporary in new glossy green and purple colors.\n \nThe new Medusa Anthem shoe line clashes cutesy sandal, boot, and Mary Jane styles with a heavy-metal XL rubber sole made for the Versace club-kid.\n \nSee more from the runway at Versace.com.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoKDrFyQDy0	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hoKDrFyQDy0/hqdefault.jpg	youtube	scraped	UCrx5pVziMo1qzF8isicR5SQ	Versace	2022-09-23 23:24:26	11021235	248063		878	t

5Tc4ruN1xR8	CHANEL Cruise 2025/26 Show — CHANEL Shows	Presented at the mythical Villa d’Este, on the banks of Lake Como in Italy, the CHANEL Cruise 2025/26 collection is an ode to cinematic glamour and to the joy of getting dressed up to be noticed. On the terrace of the legendary hotel, a radiant elsewhere takes shape.\n\nStrings of beads, black sunglasses and long gloves, sequins and lamé reflect the Hollywood charm of the collection. Peach, pink or blue, pastel tones meet sun-kissed colours in ochre, yellow and orange on tweed suits. This insouciant and sunny spirit is also reflected in revisited cruise codes, with straight-cut white trousers, pea coat and stripes. The lacework, inspired by the flowers in the Villa's garden, offer a touch of delicacy to the silhouettes. Taffeta ball gowns, backless jumpsuit, and long capes: a carefree elegance and a spirit of celebration run through the collection.\n\nSee more at https://chanel.com/-YT-RTW_Cruise25-26\n\n#CHANELCruise #CHANELShow\n\nDiscover more videos by subscribing to the House’s YouTube channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCclHSnngVTZK7LEOQAzcg1w?sub_confirmation=1\n \nFollow CHANEL on:\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/chanelofficial\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/chanel\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/chanel/\n\nCredits: "'Follow Me to San Jose' by AtomTM\n(Uwe SCHMIDT) Written, produced and arranged by AtomTM\n(P) AtomTM_Audio_Archive\n(C) Rueckbank represented by Because Editions.\n \n'Sway (The Rip Off Artist Remix)' by Dean Martin, Julie London\n(Pablo Beltran Almara, Luis Demetrio Traconis Molina)\nadapted by Norman Gimbel.

SUBSCRIBE! ►► http://bit.ly/iotbs_sub  \n↓↓↓ More info and sources below ↓↓↓\n\nAmong living things, the color blue is oddly rare. Blue rocks, blue sky, blue water, sure. But blue animals? They are few and far between. And the ones that do make blue? They make it in some very strange and special ways compared to other colors. In this video, we'll look at some very cool butterflies to help us learn how living things make blue, and why this beautiful hue is so rare in nature.\n\nSPECIAL THANKS:\nSmithsonian Institution - National Museum of Natural History\nBob Robbins, Ph.D. - Curator of Lepidoptera\nJuan Pablo Hurtado Padilla - Microscope Educator\n\nRichard Prum, Ph.D. - Yale University\nVinothan Manoharan, Ph.D. - Harvard University\n\nSOURCES:\n\nBagnara, J.

8vg2D3Pi9Rk	Trump-Musk row explodes as billionaire claims President named in Epstein files | BBC News	The political partnership between Donald Trump and Elon and Elon Musk has exploded  in spectacular fashion with a bitter war of words.\n\nIt began when Mr Trump said he was “surprised and disappointed” at Elon Musk’s criticism of his flagship spending bill.   He said they had had a “great relationship” but “I don’t know if we will any more”. \n\nElon Musk responded on his social media platform X with a series of increasingly heated remarks about his former boss.   He said the President’s claims that he has supported the budget bill were “false”.   He said Mr Trump was  “ungrateful” for his help in getting elected and would have lost the election without his financial support.   Mr Musk warned that the President’s tariffs policy would lead to a recession.\n\nThen Musk made an explosive allegation, claiming without evidence that Donald Trump is named in the files about the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.  He said that “is the real reason they have not been made public”.\n\nDonald Trump suggested that the easiest way to save money would be to terminate the billions of dollars in government contracts and subsidies that go to Elon Musk’s companies.   Musk said that President Trump should be impeached.\n\nReeta Chakrabarti presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Sarah Smith and Simon Jack.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vg2D3Pi9Rk	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8vg2D3Pi9Rk/hqdefault.jpg	youtube	scraped	UC16niRr50-MSBwiO3YDb3RA	BBC News	2025-06-06 03:44:44	970058	13807	bbc, bbc news, news, world news, breaking news, us news, world, america, usa, usa news, india news, Trump, Musk, Tesla, row, Jeffrey, Epstein, sex, offender, allegation, claims, crime, criminal, files, budget, Truth, social, President, meltdown, feud, bitter, impeachment, impeached, contracts, cancel, Space X, tariffs, DOGE, twitter, impeach, lies, smears, richest, fury, bromance, government, federal, congress, insults, attack, election, bill, rage, alliance, allies, enemies, Congress, republican, democrat, paedophile, Ghislaine, Maxwell	390	t

LYrju7FpNhc	Nobel Prize Winner Warns: “It’s a Different Universe” the James Webb Telescope Saw Strange Things...	#jameswebbtelescope #jwst #jameswebbspacetelescope \nNobel Prize Winner Warns: “It’s a Different Universe” the James Webb Telescope Saw Strange Things... \n\nA Nobel Prize-winning physicist has just dropped a cosmic bombshell: the James Webb Space Telescope isn’t just showing us clearer stars and galaxies — it’s revealing a completely different universe. From ancient galaxies that shouldn’t exist to structures that defy the laws of physics, what the JWST is seeing is rewriting everything we thought we knew about space, time, and the Big Bang.\n\nThe warning? These aren't just quirky anomalies — they're challenging our entire cosmological model. This could mean that the universe isn’t expanding the way we believed or that dark energy behaves in ways we never imagined. Some theories even suggest that the fabric of spacetime might be more complex than Einstein predicted.\n\n👁️‍🗨️ In this video, we’ll break down what the Nobel Laureate is saying, what the James Webb Telescope actually saw, and why this might be the most important scientific discovery of our lifetime.\n\n💼 Business Inquiries and Contact\n• For business inquiries, copyright matters or other inquiries please contact us at: cosmosprodigy@gmail.com\n\n⚠️ Copyright Disclaimers\n• We use images and content in accordance with the YouTube Fair Use copyright guidelines\n• Section 107 of the U.S. Copyright Act states: “Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright.” \n• This video could contain certain copyrighted video clips, pictures, or photographs that were not specifically authorized to be used by the copyright holder(s), but which we believe in good faith are protected by federal law and the fair use doctrine for one or more of the reasons noted above.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYrju7FpNhc	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LYrju7FpNhc/hqdefault.jpg	youtube	scraped	UCBBrNSvlOsSS5Z3JA4IqlBQ	Cosmos Prodigy	2025-05-10 05:57:52	710490	10947		886	t

JLNq5HOX4Es	Flying ride on kids rocket ship to launch satellite in space for eclipse. Educational | Kid Crew	In this video we pretend to be an astronaut and head to space in our ride on kids rocket ship to prepare for the solar eclipse! We're putting down the power wheels for the day to fly high in our solar system. We also play with our Lego space toys inside! \n\nFirst, we arrive at the space shuttle launch pad and receive our mission. Launch a satellite to study space before the total solar eclipse. We open the rocket's canopy and buckle up. We raise the launch platform and grab the joysticks as the launch sequence initiates. 3 2 1 liftoff! The ride on rocket ship blasts into the sky and soon we are in space. This is way faster than any of our trucks. We open the cargo bay doors and deploy the satellite just in time for the eclipse. Then we head to Mars in our rocket ship to pick up some space garbage. We make a smooth landing and then collect the trash. We hop back in our rocket after walking on the martian surface and head back to earth. Its a successful mission! After cleaning up that mess, we head inside to play with our Lego space toy sets. First an out of control satellite collides with a space shuttle and then crashes on the moon. The space shuttle is OK, and calls mission control for help. A rocket is deployed and goes to the moon to collect the satellite with the help of a rover team. They find the wreckage and head back to earth. They splash down in the bath tub where a boat is ready to retrieve them.  In the educational segment we learn how a solar eclipse works with a moving diorama in the back yard. Remember, don't look at an eclipse without approved eclipse glasses. \n\nCome pretend play with us! Join us kids, toddlers, girls, and boys as we use our ride on toy trucks, toy tractors, and toy equipment to do construction, farming, and home improvement pretend play projects. While we play our games and drive our vehicles, we learn about engineering, science, STEM, and how things work in our educational segment.

yEkDosanxGk	Architecture is a Language: Daniel Libeskind at TEDxDUBLIN	TEDxDublin was hosted by Science Gallery at the Bord Gáis Energy Theatre on September 8th, 2012. http://www.TEDxDublin.com\n\nDaniel Libeskind believes that buildings are crafted with perceptible human energy, and that they address the greater cultural context in which they are built. Best known for designing iconic buildings like the Jewish Museum in Berlin and the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, Libeskind also designed the Bord Gáis Energy Theatre and the masterplan for the new World Trade Center site in New York City. His commitment to expanding the scope of architecture reflects his profound interest and involvement in philosophy, art, literature and music. \n\nIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEkDosanxGk	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yEkDosanxGk/hqdefault.jpg	youtube	scraped	UCsT0YIqwnpJCM-mx7-gSA4Q	TEDx Talks	2012-09-19 18:25:55	616306	9189	Daniel Libeskind, ted talks, Sustainability, ted, Culture, ted x, English, Design, Ireland, TEDxDUBLIN, community, tedx talks, ted talk, tedx talk, Architecture, cities, tedx	1109	t

FtGTE3qJvWY	Architecture A to Z [Guide to Popular Concepts]	This video introduces and defines common architecture terms from A to Z. It is no secret that architecture is full of jargon and unique vocabulary. This can be the subject of jokes and memes but it can also lead to confusion and frustration. The reliance on jargon is somewhat forgivable — the task of translating complex spatial, geometric, and compositional principles into verbal language is difficult. However, it means that one must invest in learning the language to fully grasp written and verbal communication about buildings. This video helps by providing definitions for 26 common architectural terms in alphabetical order. Terms include: aesthetic, buttress, circulation, diagrammatic, enfilade, fenestration, geodesic, hierarchy, iconic, jamb, kitsch, legibility, morphology, node, ornament, program, quoin, rustication, stereotomy, tectonics, urbanism, yurt, and zeitgeist. Whether you're in architecture school, or an architecture enthusiast, armed with this fundamental vocabulary, you’ll be able to keep up with any architectural conversation.  \n\n__Membership__\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYAm24PkejQR2xMgJgn7xwg/join\n\n__About the Channel__\nArchitecture with Stewart is a YouTube journey exploring architecture’s deep and enduring stories in all their bewildering glory.

NFPus3Vm1TU	Top 5 - Ancient Indian Martial Arts | Independence day special	Ancient Indian Martial Arts- When you say Martial arts the first thing that comes to your mind is Kung Fu, Karate and maybe China & Japan for being the birth place of these Martial arts. But did you know that Martial arts as a concept came from Southern parts of India? There are even written scriptures that the Person who taught Kung fu to East Asia was BodhiDharma who was actually a South Indian King. INDIA is the birth place of Martial arts and somehow we end up looking up to the east.\n\nIDEA SUGGESTION - Fighter stars - Thank you very much for your suggestion \n\nmusic - www.bensound.com\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/simblychumma\n\nMail us at    "simblychumma@gmail.com'\n\ntags - Simbly Chumma, top 5, top 10, Top 5 tamil, Top 10 Tamil, martial arts, 7 immortals, mythological characters still alive, mythical creatures, ancient indian martial arts, martials arts in india, indian martial arts, kallaripayattu, kung fu, karate, silambattam, martial, arts, india, bruce lee, kalaripayattu, kerala, sword, combat, indians in america got talent, judo, muay thai, krav maga, bodhidharma, 7aam arivu, parashurama, shiva, ravana, fight, war, art,\n\n-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-\nPlease watch: "10 - Best Male Dancers in Indian Film Industry " \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5HRl8PHeP0\n-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-\n\nAbout Simbly Chumma:\n\nA channel with Ranking style videos on some of the most interesting subjects based on INDIA!\n\nChumma in Tamil means - JUST LIKE THAT. \n\nAnd that's the essence of this channel. \nWe are an Infotainment channel where we are going to talk about everything.

KFTV-wcTCpw	Beautiful Animal Moments - Dog, Cat, Chicken, Elephant, Cow, Sheep - Animal Sounds	Let's explore the beautiful moments of animals and the unique sounds they make. Dogs often bark to communicate and express their emotions. Cats meow to get attention or purr when they feel relaxed. Chickens cluck when laying eggs or communicating with each other. Elephants have a loud trumpeting sound, expressing their communication and emotions. Cows have a distinctive moo, often used to communicate within the herd. Sheep bleat endearingly, usually to communicate with each other and their lambs.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFTV-wcTCpw	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KFTV-wcTCpw/hqdefault.jpg	youtube	scraped	UCP8-TGiDpXqZOsr1zhcQ7CA	Animal Moments	2024-07-20 16:30:28	19956934	82348	animal, animal moments, animal sounds, farm animals, wild animals, Animal Moment, Beautiful Animal, Dog, Cat, Chicken, Elephant, Cow, Sheep, Dog sound, Cow sound, Cat sound, Chicken sound, Elephant sound	989	t

ps7lSAG1nIg	Quick & Easy Crochet Bucket Hat Tutorial	*UPDATED TUTORIAL:* https://youtu.be/I6m_woyNvZk\n*Updated printable pattern:* https://vivcrochets.etsy.com/listing/1822364837/easy-crochet-bucket-hat-pattern-pdf\n*Updated free pattern:* https://vivcrochets.com/easy-crochet-bucket-hat-free-pattern-tutorial\n\nWritten pattern: https://vivcrochets.com/bucket-hat\n\nHello!! Here's a quick and easy tutorial on how to crochet a simple bucket hat! This pattern can be adjusted to fit any size and be easily customized. This is a perfect beginner's first project because it utilizes the most basic stitches and concepts.\n\nSome links may be affiliate links! I earn a small commission at no additional cost to you!\n\nMaterials:\nRed Heart Super Saver Yarn in "White": https://amzn.to/3XlxBW0\n5mm hook (I recommend Clover Amour Hooks: https://amzn.to/3noE9mz)\nScissors\nYarn Needle\n\nThis pattern does require a magic circle (MC), but you can substitute that by chaining 4 and slip stitching to the first chain. This hat uses mainly the double crochet (dc), sometimes in the back loop only (BLO) or front loop only (FLO), and slip stitches (sl st) to join each round.\n\nThe yarn that I used was size 4 acrylic (~150 yds), but many different yarn types are suitable for this pattern! I also used a 5 mm hook and a yarn needle.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\nTimestamps:\n0:00 Materials\n0:10 Top\n6:55 Middle\n8:33 Brim\n10:50 Weaving in Ends\n\n#buckethat #diybuckethat #crochetbuckethat	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ps7lSAG1nIg	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ps7lSAG1nIg/hqdefault.jpg	youtube	scraped	UCcx52IM2OikhWgVF_TPzqrQ	VivCrochets	2021-06-11 20:30:20	6191391	117785	diy bucket hat, crochet bucket hat, crochet hat tutorial, crochet sun hat, how to crochet bucket hat, how to crochet a hat, quick crochet hat, easy crochet hat, easy crochet bucket hat, easy diy bucket hat, crochet bucket hat tutorial, crochet simple bucket hat, quick and easy bucket hat, bucket hat, how to make a bucket hat, bucket hat tutorial, diy bucket hat tutorial, crochet hat, bucket hat crochet, how to crochet a bucket hat, bucket hat crochet tutorial, crochet	841	t
l5k1ai_GBDE	Terraform explained in 15 mins | Terraform Tutorial for Beginners	Terraform explained for Beginners | Terraform Tutorial for Beginners | Terraform Architecture explained\n\nUnderstand what Terraform is, its use cases, how it works and how it's different from Ansible 💡\n\nTerraform is a tool for infrastructure provisioning to build out infrastructure through code, often called Infrastructure as Code. So, Terraform allows you to automate and manage your infrastructure, your platform and your services that run on that platform. It's open source and declarative, which means you define WHAT you want (the desired "end state") rather then describing exactly each step or HOW to do it.\n\nIn this tutorial you will learn what Terraform exactly is, Terraforms use cases or what it's used for, Terraforms Architecture and the basic commands. In addition I also clarify the question of what the difference of Terraform and Ansible is, because they seem to do the same thing.\n\nFurthermore I also go one step deeper and explain what the terms and concepts of "infrastructure provisioning", "infrastructure as code" or "declarative vs imperative" mean. 💡\n\nSo, with this Terraform Tutorial you get a really good overview of what Terraform is, how Terraform works, how it does its job to get started quickly. 🙌🏼\n\n#terraform #terraformtutorial #infrastructureascode #devops #techworldwithnana\n\n▬▬▬▬▬▬ T I M E S T A M P S ⏰ ▬▬▬▬▬▬ \n0:00 - Intro\n0:30 - What is Terraform?

WO_jJge0ZTc	7 RULES OF INVESTING WARREN BUFFETT HINDI | MASTER THE BASICS OF RULES OF INVESTING | WARREN BUFFETT	Do you know how Warren Buffett thinks about his investments...?\n\n7 Rules of investing (see full video to understand in detail)\n\nRule no 1 hai LEARN A LOT / READ A LOT:- yaani the more you learn the more you earn. Ham sab paiso ki compounding ko to jaante hai lekin knowledge ki compounding ke liye ham bhaut hi kam sochte ya invest karte hai.  \n\nRule no 2 tha:-Investing ka second rule hai Know what you Own:- jisme hamne 7 th class ke bacho ki story dekhi thi ki agar ham bhaut hi simple words me ye bhi bata sakte ki company kaunse product bana rhi hai aur aage kaise apni earnings badhaayegi. To better hai aise businesses se ham dur hi rahe.\n\nRule no 3 tha:- Over the long term, it's better to buy stocks in small companies.:- yaani chotti company percentage wise zaada grow ho sakti hai as compared to already jo big giants hai. Ab aisa hamesha true nhi hai lekin maximum cases me aisa hi dekha gaya hai.\n\nRule no 4 tha :-Hold no more stocks that you can remain informed on.:- yaani utne hi stocks lo jinki stories par ham nazar rakh paaye. Warren buffett to kehte hai ki agar life me hame 3 achi companies mil gayi hai to vohi hamari life ko bahaut improve kar degi/\n            \nRule no 5 tha :- If you like the product chances are you will love the stock.:- in short agar product bhaut se logo ko pasand aa raha hai to ye ek acha screen test hai iske baad ham company ki research karke uske baare me aur pata kar sakte hai aur ho sakta hai ki hame achi company mil hi jaaye.\n\nRule no 6 tha:- Trying to time the market: yaani market me kab enter ya exit karna hai is se better hai ki ham ache businesses dhunde jo actual me grow kare. Kyunki lambe time me share ki growth aur business ki growth almost same hi hogi.\n\nAur finally rule no 7 mein humne seekha tha:-FREE Cash Flow is the king… yaani sirf earnings par hi vishwaas na kare balki free cashflow ek perfect indicator hai company ke baare me bataane ka. Aur agar cashflow negative hai to ye matlab bhi hi ki company kharab hai iske true reason ko janne ke liye hame company ki annual reports padhni padegi unki earning calls sunni padhegi. Achi companies bhi itni aasani se nhi milti mehnat to karni padti hai.\n\nI HOPE YE VIDEO AAPKO PASAND AAYI HOGI?\n\nJAI HIND.\n\nI hope These 3 Resources will help you in your Life \n\nDOWNLOAD GIGL APP FOR FREE BOOK SUMMARIES:-\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gigl.app&referrer=utm_source%3Dyoutube%26utm_medium%3D02052021%26anid%3Dadmob\n\nDOWNLOAD GIGL APP FOR FREE BOOK SUMMARIES (IoS apple):-\nhttps://apps.apple.com/in/app/gigl-hindi-audiobook-summaries/id1548413910\n\nGIGL BUSINESS CHANNEL\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZt6GXD3VnY4rsvXqLX8IQw\n\nGIGL VIDEO APP FOR FREE COURSES ON BUSINESS AND INVESTMENT\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.video.gigl.app&hl=en&gl=US	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO_jJge0ZTc	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WO_jJge0ZTc/hqdefault.jpg	youtube	scraped	UCurYxozQbvKn-oNUxNJh45Q	GREAT IDEAS GREAT LIFE	2021-11-28 10:07:30	2614534	81194	RULES OF INVESTING, WARREN BUFFETT, PETET LYNCH, WARREN BUFFETT HOW TO ACHIEVE A GOOD RETURN, WARREN BUFFETT BIOGRAPHY, 7 INVESTMENT RULE IN HINDI, INVESTMENT KAISE KARE, INVESTMENT BANKING, INVESTMENT RULES, 5 INVESTMENT RULES, HOW TO CHOSE STOCKS, WARREN BUFFETT INVESTMENT RULES IN HINDI, INVESTMENT RULES OF RAKESH JHUNJUNWALA, SANDEEP MAHESWARI ON WARREN BUFFETT, HOW TO GET RICH WITH POWER OF COMPUNDING, COMPOUNDING IN INVESTMENT, THE INTELLIGENT INVESTOR, RULES OF MONEY	764	t

Rw37k2pTOUY	‘Very Orwellian’: Scientists reacts to Trump allowing political appointees to ‘correct’ science	A new executive order claims the Trump administration is restoring a “gold-standard” for science. However, thousands of scientists, academics and researchers have signed onto an open letter that says science is under siege.

SzJ46YA_RaA	Map of Computer Science	The field of computer science summarised. Learn more at this video's sponsor https://brilliant.org/dos\n\nComputer science is the subject that studies what computers can do and investigates the best ways you can solve the problems of the world with them. It is a huge field overlapping pure mathematics, engineering and many other scientific disciplines. In this video I summarise as much of the subject as I can and show how the areas are related to each other.\n\n#computer #science #DomainOfScience\n\nYou can buy this poster here: \nNorth America: https://store.dftba.com/products/map-of-computer-science-poster\nEverywhere else: https://www.redbubble.com/people/dominicwalliman/works/27929629-map-of-computer-science?p=poster&finish=semi_gloss&size=small\nFrench Version: https://www.redbubble.com/people/dominicwalliman/works/40572729-map-of-computer-science-french-version?asc=u\nSpanish Version: https://www.redbubble.com/people/dominicwalliman/works/40572750-map-of-computer-science-spanish-version?asc=u\nGet all my other posters here: https://www.redbubble.com/people/dominicwalliman\n\nA couple of notes on this video:\n1. Some people have commented that I should have included computer security alongside hacking, and I completely agree, that was an oversight on my part. Apologies to all the computer security professionals, and thanks for all the hard work!\n2. I also failed to mention interpreters alongside compilers in the complier section. Again, I’m kicking myself because of course this is an important concept for people to hear about. Also the layers of languages being compiled to other languages is overly convoluted, in practice it is more simple than this. I guess I should have picked one simple example.\n3. NP-complete problems are possible to solve, they just become very difficult to solve very quickly as they get bigger. When I said NP-complete and then "impossible to solve", I meant that the large NP-complete problems that industry is interested in solving were thought to be practically impossible to solve.\n\nAnd free downloadable versions of this and the other posters here.

Xu-QfE_1ksk	The science of laughter - Sasha Winkler	Explore the common scientific theories about why humans laugh, and how this universal behavior evolved.\n\n--\n\nIsn’t it odd that, when something’s funny, you might show your teeth, change your breathing, become weak and achy in some places, and maybe even cry? In other words, why do we do this bizarre thing that is laughter? Since there’s no archaeological record of laughter, it’s impossible to say exactly how and why it evolved, but scientists have some theories.

46uar-T7ufA	Single in Indonesia: Stigma and emancipation | DW Documentary	Whether single, looking for a partner or divorced – what happens when young Indonesians decide to look for love their way?\n\nIn Indonesia, marriage is still the social norm. Those who don’t conform, stand out and must often field many uncomfortable questions. Treading the fine line between familial pressure, religious duty and growing self-confidence, Indonesian singles are now seeking love in new ways. Whether divorced, separated or simply without a partner: what does it feel like to push back against society’s expectations? And in this largely traditional country, how is it possible not just to find love, but also self-fulfilment?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #reporter #indonesia #single \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Now at 17, she’s pregnant with her second child. She lives with her boyfriend Eduardo in a favela in the north of Rio de Janeiro. Money is tight and their apartment is small. There are drug deals happening right outside their front door. Heavily armed dealers stand on every corner. It's a very different world from the Rio of Sugarloaf Mountain and picturesque beaches. But Vitória and Eduardo want to make it work. Social workers and doctors at the Dara Institute are helping guide them along the difficult path.

As an expert for transgender issues at the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, Reem Sharif found a way to support her community.\n\nTrans people in Pakistan are frequently cast out by their families and live in poverty. They can find safe spaces and a new family in special centers. Here, they do not have to hide and discover that they are not alone in their fight for survival and recognition in Pakistan’s conservative society. \n\nOnly around 10 thousand people of Pakistan’s population of 220 million are officially counted as members of the “third gender,” yet it’s estimated that the true figure may be as high as 300 thousand.\n\nA report by Vanessa Juercke  \n \n#documentary #dwdocumentary #reporter #pakistan #transgender \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The couple grooved to the Baby Momma Dance in hopes of inducing labour, sparking mixed reactions online. While some praised the candid moment, others slammed it as attention-seeking and inappropriate. Piers Morgan added fuel to the fire with a controversial comment, and conspiracy theories around Meghan's pregnancy resurfaced. Alongside the video, Meghan posted heartfelt family photos and hinted at future business dreams with Lilibet.

fqu02-6c7Os	How to travel with just one bag (& zero sacrifices)	The most important travel lesson I've learned is the difference between cost vs price, and traveling with one bag, although filled with items that may have a higher PRICE, ultimately, saves on so many ongoing COSTS associated with packing too much, and in this video I share how I travel with one bag and zero sacrifices.\n\nThis enables me to have everything I need without paying for extra baggage fees, and needing to pay for taxi rides everywhere because I can't carry everything, not to mention, the constant reduction in stress and amplified enjoyment by just not needing to remember and lug stuff around, finding elevators, and all that noise… one bag travel, whenever possible, is the way to go.\n\n===============\nTIMELINE + LINKS\n===============\nSome of the links below are affiliate links.

There are slight differences with the Version 1 shown in this video, but in my opinion, Version 2 is unequivocally better. One thing that you MAY not like about the V2 that was shown in this video, is that there is no more removable mini-sling-hip-belt. Doesn't bother me because I'm very particular about my slings, but if this was a major positive feature for you, consider researching other bags for yourself. Both the 35L and 45L of the Version 2 are compliant with international (and domestic) carry-on size regulations.

10QcbISOKrg	Can psychedelics treat mental health disorders? - Anees Bahji	Dig into the science of how psychedelic drugs affect your brain, and how they could be used for psychiatric treatment.\n\n--\n\nIn 1943, chemist Albert Hofmann accidentally exposed himself to a drug he derived from ergot fungus and recorded its unexpected, mind-altering effects. The drug, lysergic acid diethylamide— or LSD— was soon heralded for its psychiatric potential. But how do LSD and other psychedelic drugs affect the body? And can they actually be medicinal? Anees Bahji explores the science of psychedelics.\n\nLesson by Anees Bahji, directed by Rowena Sheehan.\n\nSupport Our Non-Profit Mission\n----------------------------------------------\nSupport us on Patreon: http://bit.ly/TEDEdPatreon\nCheck out our merch: http://bit.ly/TEDEDShop\n----------------------------------------------\n\nConnect With Us\n----------------------------------------------\nSign up for our newsletter: http://bit.ly/TEDEdNewsletter\nFollow us on Facebook: http://bit.ly/TEDEdFacebook\nFind us on Twitter: http://bit.ly/TEDEdTwitter\nPeep us on Instagram: http://bit.ly/TEDEdInstagram\n----------------------------------------------\n\nKeep Learning\n----------------------------------------------\nView full lesson: https://ed.ted.com/lessons/can-psychedelics-treat-mental-health-disorders-anees-bahji\nDig deeper with additional resources: https://ed.ted.com/lessons/can-psychedelics-treat-mental-health-disorders-anees-bahji/digdeeper\n\nAnimator's website: https://www.rowenasheehan.com\n----------------------------------------------\n\nThank you so much to our patrons for your support!

PctECZdenuc	Your Skin Is WARNING You (Don’t Ignore This!)	Stop treating skin issues with lotions, creams, and medications and start focusing on the gut-skin connection! In this video, I’ll show you how 5 common gut problems can manifest as skin rashes and other skin issues. \n\n0:00 Introduction: 5 skin signs of colon health\n0:20 Altered microbiome \n0:53 Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)\n1:24 Gut inflammation\n3:20 Gallbladder problems and skin issues \n4:30 How to improve gut and skin health \n5:18 Probiotics for skin health\n\nHow to Make L. Reuteri Yogurt: https://drbrg.co/3GyeB3J\n[Affiliate links]\nYogurt Maker: https://amzn.to/4k1LO71\nYogurt Jars: https://amzn.to/411hSPw \nYogurt Containers: https://amzn.to/411eXX0\n\nThese 5 colon issues and gut problems can wreak havoc on your skin’s health!\n\n1. An altered microbiome means your gut contains more bad bacteria than healthy gut microbes. It’s often caused by diet or antibiotics. An altered gut microbiome can cause inflammation that can become systemic, leading to rosacea. \n\n2. SIBO is a condition where gut microbes are in the wrong place. Most microbes should be in the large intestine, not the small intestine. SIBO can lead to nutritional deficiencies, inflammation, arthritis, and rosacea. \n\n3. Gut inflammation symptoms include pain, tightness, or bloating. Gut inflammation is typically caused by diet, with gluten being one of the most common culprits. The more gut inflammation you have, the less you can absorb zinc. Zinc deficiencies are one of the most common causes of skin rashes. The carnivore diet is very beneficial for people with gut inflammation.\n\n4. If you have chronic gut inflammation, you may lose your gut villi over time. This can diminish nutrient absorption, especially the absorption of vitamin D. Many autoimmune skin issues are directly related to low vitamin D. You can increase vitamin D with supplements, sun exposure, and certain types of light therapy.\n\n5. If you’ve had your gallbladder removed or you have low bile, you may develop skin issues. Without enough bile, you won’t be able to break down and digest the fat-soluble vitamins, especially vitamin A. To increase vitamin A, consume beef liver or cod liver oil. \n\nOx bile, purified bile salts, or TUDCA can help if you have a sluggish gallbladder or have had your gallbladder removed. \n\nTo improve gut and skin health, take a good probiotic and consume fermented foods like sauerkraut, kimchi, raw milk cheese, yogurt, and raw salad from the garden. The carnivore diet can significantly improve gut health, reduce skin issues, and improve autoimmune conditions.\n\nIf you have SIBO, do intermittent fasting and OMAD. Try acidifying the stomach with betaine hydrochloride or apple cider vinegar. \n\nYou can make your own L. reuteri probiotic mixture to improve your gut and skin health significantly. L. reuteri can live in the small and large intestine and has multiple benefits, including improved digestion and the improvement of skin issues like acne.\n\nDr. Eric Berg DC Bio:\nDr. Berg, age 60, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting. He is the author of the best-selling book The Healthy Keto Plan, and is the Director of Dr. Berg Nutritionals.

His use of “doctor” or “Dr.” in relation to himself solely refers to that degree. Dr. Berg is a licensed chiropractor in Virginia, California, and Louisiana, but he no longer practices chiropractic in any state and does not see patients, so he can focus on educating people as a full-time activity, yet he maintains an active license.

It should not be used to self-diagnose, and it is not a substitute for a medical exam, cure, treatment, diagnosis, prescription, or recommendation. It does not create a doctor-patient relationship between Dr. Berg and you. You should not make any change in your health regimen or diet before first consulting a physician and obtaining a medical exam, diagnosis, and recommendation. Always seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition.\n\n#health #keto #ketodiet #weightloss #ketolifestyle #intermittentfasting #lowcarb \n\nThanks for watching!

fyO8pvpnTdE	5 Parenting Styles and Their Effects on Life	There are four widely researched styles of parenting: authoritative, permissive, authoritarian, and neglectful. The styles range from controlling to undemanding, and from cold and unresponsive to loving and receptive. In recent years, over-involved parents, who are present in every aspect of their child’s life, are often referred to as the fifth style. They are also known as snowplow or helicopter parents. #parenting \n\nSupport our work and become a patreon:\nhttps://patreon.com/sprouts\n\nNever miss a new video with our newsletter:\nhttp://eepurl.com/dNU4BQ \n\nFree Masterclass: 👉\nTo teach your children well and embrace good parenting to set your kids up for real contentment, check out our free Masterclass \nhttps://go.mindvalley.com/sprouts-parenting \n\nFun and related:\nSystems theory - How to organise a Children's Party\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miwb92eZaJg \n\nChapters:\n0:00 Parenting styles\n1:07 Authoritarian parenting\n2:08 Permissive parenting\n3:00 Authoritative parenting\n4:02 Neglectful parenting\n4:48 Over-Involved parenting\n5:32 Research\n5:50 Tips for parents\n6:14 What do you think?\n\nUseful links\nLink to full script: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zUDbq3Qi1OPcxDjRbmhQGxifshSKn2HG-hqxVlB5yEA/edit?usp=sharing\n\nSources\nParenting styles: An evidence-based, cross-cultural guide\nhttps://www.parentingscience.com/parenting-styles.html \n\nParenting Styles: A Closer Look at a Well-Known Concept\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6323136/#:~:text=Based%20on%20the%20combination%20of,and%20high%20responsiveness \n\nParenting Dimensions and Styles: A Brief History and Recommendations for Future Research \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3746212/\n\nAcademic competence and parenting styles, as meta-analysis\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/281561178_Associations_of_Parenting_Styles_and_Dimensions_with_Academic_Achievement_in_Children_and_Adolescents_A_Meta-analysis \n\nMeta-analysis of research from 1,435 studies on associations of parenting dimensions https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28459276/ \n\nTiger moms\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_parenting \n\nThank you to our patrons\n\nThis video was made with the support of our Patrons: Enrique Arellano Farias, Vishruth Harithsa, Nancy Bueffler, Adam G, Raman Srivastava, Daniel Kramer, David Markham, Marq Short, Scripz, Muhammad Humayun, Ginger, Tsungren Yang, Esther Chiang, Badrah, Cedric Wang, Broke, Jeffrey Cassianna, Sergei Kukhariev, Andrea Basilio Rava, kritik bhimani, Don Bone, John Zhang, Mathis Nu and all the others.

CyElHdaqkjo	How to Raise Successful Kids -- Without Over-Parenting | Julie Lythcott-Haims | TED	By loading kids with high expectations and micromanaging their lives at every turn, parents aren't actually helping. At least, that's how Julie Lythcott-Haims sees it. With passion and wry humor, the former Dean of Freshmen at Stanford makes the case for parents to stop defining their children's success via grades and test scores. Instead, she says, they should focus on providing the oldest idea of all: unconditional love.\n \nWhether you’re just launching your adult life or finally giving yourself permission to question assumptions about adulthood, learn practical strategies to build a future that fits you from Julie Lythcott-Haims.

iWjYsxaBjBI	Inside the Mind of Jeffrey Dahmer: Serial Killer’s Chilling Jailhouse Interview	Warning: This video contains graphic descriptions of violence. Twenty-four years ago, Jeffrey Dahmer was beaten to death in prison while serving 16 life sentences. In 1993, the man known as “the Milwaukee Cannibal” granted Inside Edition a jailhouse interview and was forthright about his crimes. During his reign of terror between 1978 and 1991, Dahmer killed 17 men and boys and kept some of their body parts in freezers inside his home. He was eventually arrested in 1991 when a victim escaped. #InsideEdition	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWjYsxaBjBI	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iWjYsxaBjBI/hqdefault.jpg	youtube	scraped	UC9k-yiEpRHMNVOnOi_aQK8w	Inside Edition	2018-11-27 23:52:37	44267560	500344	cannibal, cat-flashback, ie flashback, inside edition, inside_edition, jailhouse interview, jeffrey dahmer, milwaukee, murder, murderer, prison, rape, serial killer	1032	t

73O81rxazoQ	How On Running Shoes Are Taking On Nike And Adidas	Nike and Adidas have long dominated the global sportswear market, but a Swiss sneaker company is quickly gaining ground. The brand On sells premium priced athletic wear and is most known for its trademark running sneakers with hollow pads in the sole. In its most recent quarter, the company reported net sales of $869 million, over 40% higher from the year prior. Meanwhile, Nike’s revenues have fallen 9% this year, compared to the same quarter last year. Nike still owns around 40% of global market share in athletic footwear, and On makes up a little under 3%, but that share has increased eightfold since 2019. Experts say On is now one of the biggest challengers in sportswear. But with Nike mounting a comeback and potential tariffs looming, can the Swiss brand maintain its edge? CNBC visited On’s headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland to get a behind-the-scenes look at the company and how its shoes are made.\n\nChapters: \n0:00 Introduction\n1:59 Chapter 1: The rise of On\n5:25 Chapter 2: Taking on Nike\n7:49 Chapter 3: Tariffs\n\nProducer: Merritt Enright\nEdited by: Andrea Miller\nGraphics: Jason Reginato, Mithra Krishnan\nAdditional footage: Getty Images, On, Reuters, Nike\n\n» Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n» Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n» Watch CNBC on the go with CNBC+: https://www.cnbc.com/WatchCNBCPlus\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

7fYv8JStX3o	WATCH: Education Secretary DEFENDS Holocaust Denial As A Diverse Viewpoint	Education Secretary Linda McMahon was humiliated during intense questioning over diversity, equity, and inclusion policies and history in education. Dr. Rashad Richey and Jackson White discuss on Indisputable. Tell us what you think in the comments below.\n\nRead more here: https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/04/linda-mcmahon-black-history-dei-policy\n\n"Linda McMahon, the education secretary, said on Wednesday she was unsure if teaching students about two of the most notorious racist episodes in US history would fall foul of the Trump administration’s onslaught against diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI).\n\nTestifying before the House of Representatives’ education and workforce subcommittee, McMahon appeared uncertain of her facts when confronted by Summer Lee, a Democratic representative from Pennsylvania. Lee asked her about the 1921 Tulsa race massacre and Ruby Bridges, a civil rights workers who as a six-year-old, braved a screaming mob to become the first Black child to attend a previously all-white school."\n\n*** \n\nIndisputable, features Dr. Richey talking about the top news stories of the day, reading viewer comments, and engaging in debates and conversations with guests.\n\nHelp support our mission and get perks.

Senator Jon Ossoff (D-GA) credited Dr. Richey’s journalism as, “Fulfilling [a] public obligation to bring facts into public light and into the awareness of policy makers that indicate a possible pattern of abuse, misconduct, and racism.”\n\nhttps://radioink.com/2023/03/14/indisputable-podcast-passes-the-million-mark/\n\nSUBSCRIBE on YOUTUBE: ☞  http://www.youtube.com/IndisputableTYT\nFACEBOOK: ☞ http://www.facebook.com/IndisputableTYT\nTWITTER: ☞ http://www.twitter.com/IndisputableTYT\nINSTAGRAM: ☞ http://www.instagram.com/IndisputableTYT\nTWITCH: ☞ http://www.twitch.com/tyt\n\n👕 Merch: http://shoptyt.com\n\n❤ Donate: http://www.tyt.com/go\n\n🔗 Website: https://www.tyt.com\n\n📱App: http://www.tyt.com/app\n\n📬 Newsletters: https://www.tyt.com/newsletters/\n\n\nIf you want to watch more videos from TYT, consider subscribing to other channels in our network:\n\n\nThe Young Turks ▶   https://www.youtube.com/theyoungturks\n\nThe Damage Report ▶   https://www.youtube.com/thedamagereport\n\nTYT Sports ▶   https://www.youtube.com/tytsports\n\nThe Conversation ▶   https://www.youtube.com/tytconversation\n\nRebel HQ ▶   https://www.youtube.com/rebelhq\n\nTYT Investigates ▶   https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwNJt9PYyN1uyw2XhNIQMMA\n\n\n\n#TYT #IndisputableTYT #News\n\n\n\n250605__ID06Linda	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fYv8JStX3o	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7fYv8JStX3o/hqdefault.jpg	youtube	scraped	UC9bMcW0MFzOAgfQ-7et47zw	Indisputable with Dr. Rashad Richey	2025-06-06 05:00:01	26597	1373	250605__ID06Linda, News, Politics, TYT, The Young Turks, Cenk Uygur, Progressive, TYT Network, Ana Kasparian, Indisputable, Dr. Richey, Dr. Rashad Richey, Indisputable Dr Richey, President Joe Biden, rashad richey, civil rights, social justice, Jackson White, Linda McMahon, donald trump, trump, maga, republicans, conservatives, elon musk, trump administration, trump supporters, jd vance, holocaust, scott jennings, cnn, tulsa race massacre, ruby bridges	710	t

The Devs Wrote\n "HELLDIVERS™ 2 is a 3rd person squad-based shooter that sees the elite forces of the Helldivers battling to win an intergalactic struggle to rid the galaxy of the rising alien threats. From a 3rd person perspective, players use a variety of weapons (pistols, machine guns, flamethrowers) and stratagems (turrets, airstrikes, etc.) to shoot and kill the alien threats. Players can also aim down the sights for a more accurate 1st person camera view. Combat is accompanied by frequent sprays of blood and dismemberment as players exterminate the alien forces or players and squad mates are hit by environmental explosions or friendly fire. Enemy encampments and battlefield environments depict bloodstains and dismembered corpses."\n_____________________________________\nThanks for Watching	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqdoewsaw1Y	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Vqdoewsaw1Y/hqdefault.jpg	youtube	scraped	UCcnkqkNWjiwLcDUx0WshOmg	Glitch Unlimited	2025-06-06 22:20:20	61859	2014	helldivers 2 patch, helldivers 2 patch notes, helldivers 2 patch changes, helldivers 2 patch today, helldivers 2 leaked, helldivers 2 big update, helldivers 2 content update, helldivers 2 coming updates, helldivers 2 leaks, helldivers 2 gamebreaking glitches, helldivers 2 game breaking bugs, Helldivers 2 Leaks, Helldiver 2 Warbond, Glitch Unlimited	655	t

kLUQqUM4Qiw	Silver Breaks Out To 13-Year High | Steve Penny	Steve Penny (https://silverchartist.com/) discusses silver’s recent breakout past $35.50, calling it a key level that could lead to much higher prices, possibly reaching $50 in the near term. He emphasizes the strength of the current uptrend not only in silver but also in other metals like gold, and platinum, which are all confirming long-term bullish patterns. Penny highlights a historic "cup and handle" chart pattern in silver dating back to 1980, suggesting a path toward $50 silver before a potential pullback. He also underscores platinum’s breakout and undervaluation relative to gold, calling it a high-risk, high-reward opportunity. For investors, he suggests dollar-cost averaging with a focus on undervalued metals like silver and platinum, using ratios like gold-to-silver to guide strategic swaps.\n\nWEEKLY SPECIALS:\n1 oz Engelhard Prospector silver rounds: $4.79 over spot\n1 oz Asahi Silver rounds: $2.79 over spot\n1/10 oz Gold Maples: $39.99 over melt\n90% constitutional pre-1965 dimes/quarters: $1.99 over spot/oz\nCall for swap/buyback deals\nCALL US: 1-888-81-LIBERTY (1-888-815-4237)\nor email your name and phone number to LibertyAndFinance@Protonmail.com\n\nINTERVIEW TIMELINE:\n0:00 Intro\n1:16 Silver at 13-year high\n7:00 Platinum breakout\n10:00 Gold update\n15:00 Buying opportunities\n18:00 Swap & buyback specials\n_____________________________\nSubscribe for our FREE newsletter - #1 place for gold & silver news & commentary: http://libertyandfinance.com\n_____________________________\nCANADIANS CAN NOW BUY SILVER & GOLD ONLINE IN $CAD and support this channel!

Through this video, I have provided a structured comparison, highlighting the strengths and limitations of each approach without bias.\n\nYou will understand the practical realities of managing your own stock portfolio, the professional management style of mutual funds, the role of advisory services in guiding investment decisions, and how smallcase fits into the broader landscape.\n\nWe have focused on clarifying:\n\n* What each approach fundamentally requires from an investor.\n* How to think about your own skill set, time commitment, and risk appetite while selecting an investment route.\n* Common misconceptions and mistakes to avoid.\n\n🎯 If you found this discussion insightful, subscribe to the channel for more serious, educational content on personal finance and investing.\n\nFeel free to share your thoughts or questions in the comments. \nWe're here to build a community of informed investors.\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n00:00 - Introduction\n01:46 - Direct Stocks\n02:39 - Mutual Funds\n05:52 - Smallcase\n08:59 - Assisted Investing\n12:08 - The best way for an investor\n13:24  - Conclusion\n________________________________________________________________________\n\nGet in Touch: \n⏩ Email Us - support@finology.in\n🌐 Website - https://www.finology.in/\n📞 For queries, contact - 022-489-66660\n_________________________________________________________________________\n\n➡️ Join my WhatsApp channel : https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va8OXlYBVJl0V9G87p1O\n\n➡️ Get Finology 30: https://tinyurl.com/finology-30-stocks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9tJBSaBAlE	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B9tJBSaBAlE/hqdefault.jpg	youtube	scraped	UCwAdQUuPT6laN-AQR17fe1g	Finology with Pranjal	2025-06-05 19:28:31	53602	2635	pranjal kamra, finology, value investing, stock market for beginners, stock market tutorial, value investing for beginners, stock market in india, mutual funds 2025, mutual funds India, smallcase, mutual fund for beginners, investment guide, how to invest, smallcase investment, smallcase vs mutual fund, smallcase review, stock market news, investment for beginners	1059	t

9jTkpeXLm8E	Quick Pressure Cooker KHEER Recipe with JAGGERY PUDA (Malpua) | पंजाबी खीर पुडे़ | Sanjyot Keer	Black Bowl - https://links.yflhome.com/yflhomeblackbowlyt\n\nFull written recipe - Punjabi Kheer Puda\n\nPrep time: 30-40 minutes (includes soaking & resting time)\nCooking time: 40-45 minutes\nServes: 5-6 people\n\nKheer\nIngredients:\nTUKDA BASMATI | टुकड़ा बासमती 1/4 CUP\nWATER | पानी AS REQUIRED (for washing & soaking the rice)\nMILK | दूध 1 LITRE (FULL FAT)\nCONDENSED MILK | कंडेंस्ड मिल्क 200 ML / 275 GRAMS\nALMONDS | बादाम 1/4 CUP (SOAKED, PEELED & SLICED)\nMethod:\nWash & soak the rice in a bowl for 15-20 minutes. Then discard the water & add the soaked rice into a pressure cooker.\nFurther add the milk & stir it well. Put the cooker’s lid on & cook over high flame for exactly 5 minutes or until the pressure builds, then place the cooker on the smallest burner & cook it over the lowest flame for 30 minutes.\nThen switch off the flame & let the cooker de-pressurize naturally. Open the pressure cooker’s lid & stir the kheer, the milk will have reduced & the colour has changed slightly. Switch on the flame & bring the kheer to a boil.\nFurther add the condensed milk & cook the kheer further, if you are going to serve it hot then cook it until the desired consistency is achieved, but if you are going to serve it cold then keep it slightly runny as the kheer will thicken up significantly once cooled. So, if you are going to serve it chilled, do no cook it for more them 6-8 minutes.\nLastly add the slivered almonds & your delicious Kheer is ready. Bring it down to room temperature & keep it in the fridge while you make the Puda.\n\nJaggery Pude\nIngredients:\nJAGGERY | गुड़ 1/2 CUP OR 80 GRAMS (CHOPPED)\nHOT WATER | गरम पानी 1 CUP \nSAFFRON | केसर A FEW STRANDS\nWHEAT FLOUR | गेहूं का आटा 1 CUP / 120 GRAMS\nFENNEL SEEDS | सौंफ 2 TSP (COARSELY CRUSHED)\nCARDAMOM POWDER | इलायची पाउडर 1/4 TSP\nBLACK PEPPERCORNS | साबुत काली मिर्च 1 TSP (COARSELY CRUSHED)\nSALT | नमक A PINCH\nWATER | पानी 3 TBSP OR AS REQUIRED (for adjusting consistency of the batter)\nGHEE | घी AS REQUIRED (for cooking)\nMethod:\nAdd the hot water to the jaggery & add the saffron strands as well, stir it & let it rest for a couple of minutes until the jaggery melts completely & the water comes down to room temperature.\nMeanwhile, add the wheat flour into a large bowl along with all the remaining fry ingredient & mix well.\nOnce the jaggery melts, add the jaggery water gradually into the bowl & whisk well to make lump-free smooth batter. Once you have added all the jaggery water & if the batter seems too thick, you can add more water, 1 tablespoon at a time, it should be a semi-thick flowing batter.\nCover & let the batter rest for 30 minutes.\nTo cook the puda, I prefer to shallow fry them on a tawa. Set a tawa over high flame & let it get got, then add 1-2 teaspoons of ghee & let it heat up.\nFurther pour a small ladle full of the batter, it will form into a circular shape on its own. I like to make mini pude, you can adjust the size as per your preference by adding more or less batter at a time. If you are making mini pude then you can cook multiple at a time like how I have.\nCook the pude over medium high flame until the turn crisp from once side, then flip & cook them similarly on the other side.\nYour deliciousPudas are ready, serve them hot with some chilled kheer\n\n#yfl #SanjyotKeer #kheer #pude #malpua \n\nFollow Your Food Lab on:\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/yourfoodlab/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/yourfoodlab/\n\n\nFollow my personal handles here: (Chef Sanjyot Keer) \n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/sanjyotkeer/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sanjyotkeerofficial/\nhttps://x.com/sanjyotkeer\n\nThe Music I use in All my videos - https://bit.ly/3CdPbSc\n(Best for independent creators)\n\nIntro 0:00\nSoaking Rice 1:17\nCooking Kheer 1:34\nMalpua Batter 6:18\nCooking Malpua 9:36\nPlating 10:41\nOutro 12:17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jTkpeXLm8E	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9jTkpeXLm8E/hqdefault.jpg	youtube	scraped	UCe2JAC5FUfbxLCfAvBWmNJA	Your Food Lab	2025-06-06 18:30:23	41480	1758	Recipes, Comfort food, Street food, Indiancuisine	794	t
5LHWXmeZWl4	How exercise may be the ‘most potent medical intervention ever known'	It's been well known for many decades that exercise provides many benefits to our health. But a new scientific consortium is revealing new insights into just how profound exercise can be for the human body. William Brangham discussed more with Euan Ashley, a professor of cardiovascular medicine and genetics at Stanford University and the newly named chair of its department of medicine.\n\nWatch PBS News for daily, breaking and live news, plus special coverage.

xqA_T8qQB4g	💃 Making exercise fun with the classics of the 1970's!💃 70's music dance workout 💃	Welcome to music of the 1970's!  There are so many great classics from the 70's but the ones I chose are requests from viewers or they had a great beat for working out to. If there are some moves you don't enjoy, by all means, dance instead!  I always aim to make my videos fun so with having music from the 1970's, it made it a little bit easier:)  Just to mention (as I'm sure some hard core 1970's fans will tell me, the one song is from 1981, not the 70's. I had a certain song chosen but then changed it and it was only until I edited the video that I realized it was 1981 (argh!). I decided to leave it rather than not having a video go up. \n\nSince this is copyrighted music, there will likely be ads in the video so I apologize in advance, but I do not have any control over them.  When I use the copyrighted music, any income from the video goes directly to the music companies who own the rights to the popular music. If you would like to see more videos with popular music, please consider donating to my channel.  For most of my videos, I pay a subscription to a music company so I can use their music.  This isn't possible with the copyrighted music. \n\nIf you wish to donate in order to have more popular music videos, you can do so here: \nDonate through Paypal:  PayPal.Me/JulesImprovedHealth\nDonate through Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/user?u=79935482\n\nIf you enjoyed the workout, please hit the like button (thumbs up) and write a comment!

Many of these patterns even resemble geometric shapes. One of the most common? Hexagons. Why do we see this six-sided shape occur so many times in nature? This week we explore why hexagons are so common in the natural world, from honeycomb to bubbles to rocks, and what their mathematics, physics, and biology may have in common.\n\n-----------\nREAD MORE:\n\nD’Arcy Wentworth Thompson.

-J0ou6tveFk	How To Do Butterfly Knife Tricks! (Beginner Tutorial)	Here's a tutorial for the first 3 butterfly knife tricks to learn when you start!\n\nHave questions? Leave a comment on the video or start a conversation on my Discord server: https://discord.gg/RRhkqZHjJc\n\nThe tricks you will learn in this video:\nThe Basic Opening/Closing\nThe Quickdraw\nThe Figure 8 (Overhand Open/close)\n\nBalisong flipping is incredibly satisfying and fun, but it's not super popular. Balisongs are incredibly satisfying skill toys to learn and it is my hope that through my videos people will be inspired to get creative, improve, and just enjoy flipping. I never really made many beginner tutorials and I figured it is a great way to get more people interested in picking up a butterfly knife trainer and just giving it a go!\n\nIn case you're wondering, a balisong is the same thing as a butterfly knife. The word balisong is the Filipino word and is what pretty much everyone in the hobby always use. The modern balisongs that we know and love today originate from the Philippines.\n\nIf you appreciate what I do and want to help out my channel even more: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/BenshaminFlips\n\n\nTimestamps:\n\n0:00 So you want to learn butterfly knife tricks?\n\n0:28 The first trick everyone should learn\n\n2:27 You actually just learned how to close it too\n\n2:47 Super fast overview of the basic opening\n\n3:00 You've gotta do it this way next\n\n4:30 Basic Open Slow Motion\n\n4:41 The real basic open, practically speaking, the Quickdraw\n\n5:47 Quickdraw Slow Motion\n\n5:55 A flashy closing you have to know\n\n7:17 Figure 8 Slow Motion\n\n7:23 The basic opening to reverse grip	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J0ou6tveFk	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-J0ou6tveFk/hqdefault.jpg	youtube	scraped	UC0CLi4GytgcJi9oAr6ERRCQ	Benshamin Flips	2024-10-19 08:02:59	165922	3167		458	t

PEPLJmNQO7o	McLaren P1 v McLaren 750S: DRAG RACE	Change your car with Carwow: https://bit.ly/Change-Your-Car-0506\n\nIt’s time for a hypercar vs supercar showdown! \n\nWe’ve got Mat in the McLaren 750S, and he’s going up against Mark McCann in his all-new McLaren P1! It’s been 12 years since the P1’s release, so can it hold up against the much newer 750S? Let’s check out the stats. \n\nThe 750S is powered by a 4-litre twin-turbo V8 that produces 750hp and 800Nm. This power is sent to the rear wheels via a 7-speed dual-clutch, and the car weighs 1,440kg. As new, it costs £277,000. \n\nThen we come to the P1. It’s powered by a 3.8-litre twin-turbo V8, and combined they produce 916hp and 900Nm. This power is sent to the rear wheels only via a 7-speed auto, and the car tips the scales at 1,490kg. But being a hypercar, it’s oh-so much more expensive than the 750S - Mark bought his recently for £1,200,000!! \n\nSo will it be a walkover for the P1? Or could the newer 750S snatch it? There’s only one way to find out… LET’S RACE!\n\nMat’s performance car deal: https://bit.ly/Mats-Choice-0506\n\nHoly Trinity drag race: https://bit.ly/Drag-Race-0506\n\nThanks to everyone who helped set up this race:\n- 750S: @DrivenPlus \n- P1: @MarkMcCann64	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEPLJmNQO7o	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PEPLJmNQO7o/hqdefault.jpg	youtube	scraped	UCUhFaUpnq31m6TNX2VKVSVA	carwow	2025-06-07 13:34:00	971141	42711	carwow, mat watson, car review, new car review, car review 2025, new car 2025, mclaren, mclaren p1, mclaren p1 drag race, p1, mclaren hypercar, hypercar, hypercar drag race, mclaren p1 drag racing, 750, 750s, mclaren 750s, mclaren 750s drag race, mclaren 750s drag racing, mclaren supercar, mclaren hypercar race, hypercars, hyper car racing, supercar drag race, supercar drag racing, super car drag race	1188	t

tk_ZlWJ3qJI	Carnival Scam Science (and how to WIN)	Prepare to drop some knowledge next time you visit the carnival.\n\nI collected data at the carnival for a full day.  Then I used that information to figure out which games are the biggest scams using science to analyze them and show you how to beat them.  I also figured out how much the carnival actually pays for the prizes so even if you win, you lose.  And then I visited the carnival with my professional baseball playing buddy to dominate all the games.  It worked well.\n\nI started a company called CrunchLabs where we build a toy together and then I teach you all the juicy physics for how it works.

v8FqSn2VOkw	8 June 2025 Positive reaction of #Technology on human life as #Motivational #Speech by Abdulhaie	Technology: Empowering Human Potential\n\nLook around you—every screen, every device, every connection is proof of human brilliance! Technology isn’t just changing our lives; it’s elevating them. It turns dreams into reality, distances into handshakes, and struggles into solutions.\n\nThink about it: A farmer using a weather app to save his crops. A student in a remote village learning from global experts online. A doctor saving lives through telemedicine. This is the power of innovation—breaking limits and creating opportunities!\n\nYes, challenges exist, but we adapt and rise stronger. With technology, we’re not just surviving—we’re thriving. We connect faster, work smarter, and dream bigger.\n\nSo let’s embrace it! Use it to educate, heal, build, and inspire. The future isn’t waiting—it’s here, in our hands. Charge forward—because with technology, humanity’s potential is limitless!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8FqSn2VOkw	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v8FqSn2VOkw/hqdefault.jpg	youtube	scraped	UCzYPEBIQbdtnGhmHRxLzS5w	DVR NEWS	2025-06-08 05:15:12	23205	2917	@Rohingya, @ArakanTime, @Myanmar, @News, @RohingyaNews, @Song, @OnlineMarketting, @EarnMoneyOnline, @Technology, @OnlineTrading, @MakeMoneyOnline, rohingya song, rohingya news, rohingya daily news, rohingya news today, rohingya tarana, rohingya waz, rohingya gaan, arakan army, arakan rohingya salvation army, arakan songs, motivational speech, best motivational speech, motivational video, best motivational video, inspirational video, jack ma	1133	t

QjTXPcSi-mo	Health minister receives backlash over suspension of GMC Doctor	A political and social storm has erupted in Goa after the controversial suspension of Dr. Rudresh Kuttikar, a senior doctor at the Goa Medical College (GMC). The move has drawn sharp condemnation from medical associations, political parties, civil society groups, and citizens. The incident unfolded after Health Minister Vishwajit Rane conducted a surprise visit to GMC, reportedly acting on a tip-off via text message from a reporter.

It's not vibes-based investing.

hfu1cNc_dfQ	Chinese Onslaught: More Chinese Cars Coming This Year	Omoda and Jaecoo are set to expand their vehicle lineups in South Africa over the next year. The introductions will include new SUVs from both brands, featuring hybrid and fully electric powertrains.\n\nFrom the Jaecoo brand, the J5 compact SUV is scheduled to arrive in the third quarter of 2025. It will be equipped with a 1.5-litre turbocharged engine and its interior will feature a large touchscreen interface. Following this, the Jaecoo J6, an all-electric off-roader, is planned for a South African launch in the second half of 2025. The J6 will be offered with various battery options, providing a maximum range of up to 500km.\n\nOmoda will introduce the C5 HEV, a hybrid electric version of its existing C5 model. This variant will provide a more fuel-efficient option for buyers. Additionally, Omoda plans to launch the C7, a larger SUV positioned above the C5. The C7 is slated for release in the second half of 2025 and will be available with both a conventional internal combustion engine and a plug-in hybrid (PHEV) powertrain.\n\nThis expansion will increase the number of models available from the two brands and introduce new energy vehicle options to the South African market.\n\n0:00 - Intro\n0:28 - Jaecoo J5\n2:02 - Omoda C5 HEV\n3:13 - Omoda C7\n4:45 - Conclusion\n\nSave 10% on car insurance when you buy online:\nhttps://www.budgetinsurance.co.za/car-insurance/?vdn=BYCLD&utm_medium=generic direct&utm_source=carscoza\n\nVisit Cars.co.za at:\nhttps://www.cars.co.za\n\nSell your car on Cars.co.za:\nhttps://www.cars.co.za/sell-car/\n\nFollow Cars.co.za on the socials:\n\nhttps://www.twitter.com/CarsSouthAfrica\nhttps://www.facebook.com/CarsSA\nhttps://www.instagram.com/CarsSouthAfrica\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@carssouthafrica\n\nDownload the Cars.co.za App here:\n\nApple\nhttps://apps.apple.com/za/app/cars-co-za/id626789511\n\nAndroid\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mushroomcloud.cars&hl=en_ZA&gl=US\n\nHuawei App Gallery\nhttps://appgallery.huawei.com/#/app/C100880073	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfu1cNc_dfQ	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hfu1cNc_dfQ/hqdefault.jpg	youtube	scraped	UCB-mfYAd3oJLEkoMxjRAxbg	Cars.co.za	2025-06-11 18:30:13	11710	346	jaecoo, omoda, chery, jaecoo j5, hev, phev, chinese cars, omoda c5, omoda c5 hev, omoda c7, new cars for south africa, chinese cars for sa, cars.co.za, chery group, hybrid cars	421	t

bF3j5UVCSCA	InBrief: The Science of Neglect	This video explains why chronic neglect is so harmful to young children and why policies that focus on preventing neglect and promote reliable, responsive caregiving can support healthy brain development and reduce long-term health risks.  \n \nSafe, stable environments are essential for young children’s development and lifelong well-being. Science has shown that early exposure to maltreatment or neglect can disrupt the development of healthy brain architecture, affecting learning, problem-solving, and relationships. Chronic neglect—the ongoing disruption or significant absence of caregiver responsiveness—is particularly damaging, with research showing it leads to more widespread developmental impacts than abuse, despite receiving less attention in policy and practice.   \n \nThis short video is an overview of “The Science of Neglect: The Persistent Absence of Responsive Care Disrupts the Developing Brain,” a Working Paper from the National Scientific Council on the Developing Child. \n \n*Learn more about the science of neglect—as well as supportive strategies for children and caregivers—in this guide from the Center on the Developing Child at Harvard University: https://developingchild.harvard.edu/resource-guides/guide-neglect/*   \n \nView our InBrief video series for more short summaries of other topics in early childhood development, including executive function and resilience: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCCB05A22FA9C24EC \n \n#EarlyChildhoodDevelopment #Neglect #ToxicStress	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF3j5UVCSCA	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bF3j5UVCSCA/hqdefault.jpg	youtube	scraped	UChBjCaJyswxsEqz26TZrWRw	Center on the Developing Child at Harvard University	2013-10-31 19:30:55	4596790	23777	neglect, science of early childhood, childhood development, early childhood development, child development, executive functioning, toxic stress, deprivation, child abuse, Center on the Developing Child, responsiveness, learning, health, healthy development, parenting	358	t

opdWOyOpuDU	Brutalist Architecture is Ugly Commie Garbage | King_Trout	Why does so much post-war architecture look like it wants to imprison your soul? Welcome to the cold, concrete world of Brutalist Architecture—the style that gave us government buildings, public housing blocks, and university campuses that feel like Soviet interrogation centers.\n\nIn this video, we dive deep into:\n\nWhat Brutalist architecture actually is (spoiler: it's not about being "brutal"... but kinda is)\n\nThe utopian dreams behind its creation—and how they went horribly wrong\n\nWhy governments loved it, and why the public mostly hated it\n\n\nFrom Le Corbusier’s concrete dreams to decaying megastructures across the world, we explore why this architectural style rose, fell, and somehow... came back.\n\nWhether you're a fan of minimalist concrete or think every brutalist building should be replaced by a park, this one's for you.\n\nAs always, thank you for watching.\n\nMerch: https://king-trout.creator-spring.com/\nInsta: https://www.instagram.com/king_trout/\nX: https://x.com/The_King_Trout	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opdWOyOpuDU	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/opdWOyOpuDU/hqdefault.jpg	youtube	scraped	UCu4tK0LdUQjn-Z7rnFWtJiA	King Trout	2025-05-30 00:13:24	104652	11033	Brutalism, design, architecture, communism, commie blocks, king trout, king_trout, le corbusier, politics, ussr, england, building, buildings, history, soviet union, soviet, russia, wwii, post war	1154	t
iH6FvN3Wqfw	Deportation from Pakistan | DW Documentary	Pakistan is stepping up its deportation of Afghan refugees. Three million face an uncertain future. The radical Islamic Taliban rule their homeland.\n\nThey have fled the violence and terror of the Taliban: For decades, millions of Afghans have taken refuge from conflict and war in neighboring Pakistan. Many have raised families and spent the better part of their lives there. But now, Pakistan is forcing Afghan refugees—both registered and undocumented—to leave. Since the deadline for voluntary departure expired at the end of March 2025, the authorities have begun arresting refugees and transferring them to deportation centers. Nightly raids are commonplace. In the long term, the government in Islamabad plans to forcibly deport three million Afghans, including human rights activists and opponents of the Taliban. They face mortal danger if they return to their country. How do the refugees who are still in the country live amid constant fear and uncertainty? And how are they fighting for their rights?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #reporter #deportation #pakistan #afghanistan \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

rV4TmvPxxMk	The King of Wild Greens – Fiddlehead Ferns: a delicacy that fights to thrive in barren soil.	※Click "cc" on the lower right menu to choose your subtitle language.\n\nFiddlehead ferns mostly grow in barren mountain areas, where few tall or lush plants can survive. They sprout anew each year—every spring, without fail, fresh shoots emerge… and it's these tender new tips that we eat. After blanching and soaking, they can be stir-fried, mixed cold, or stewed. The fresh ones are smooth and silky on the tongue, but we prefer the dried ones—no slippery texture, just a crisp bite and the fern’s unique fragrance. This is the last batch of wild spring greens and blossoms for the year. Once we finish these, it’s time for us Yunnan folks to start eating mushrooms…\n\nHello, everyone!

W1nJWR1xR2A	I Tested the WORST TEMU Art Supplies; Everything went wrong!	Never have I ever just GIVEN UP.. But this was something! That's for sure!\n\nWe had to get Louise to experience this, just so you could see I wasn't playing up to the camera.\nI'm not sure how some companies get away with supplies like these, and it's such a shame because people will buy these without knowing better, and if it's their first experience, they may be fooled into believing that this is the standard.\n\nCompanies labeling products as 'artist quality' are also deceiving many of us.\nMy job is to expose the truth of these supplies, to provide you with the best information so you make an educated purchase for yourself.\n\nI do NOT dislike everything Temu has to offer, and have had some great experience in the past... But this was a complete Joke.. and I'm disappointed.\n\nWOULD YOU USE THEM?\n\nAlso, Ai Coloring Books....

AkLEWtsmnJA	Sindhi Kadhi + Bhuga Chawal + Arbi Tuk | Complete Sindhi Thali Recipe by Smita Deo	What’s in Today’s Sindhi Thali?\n1. Sindhi Kadhi\nA tangy, nourishing gram flour-based curry loaded with seasonal vegetables, slow-cooked to perfection and finished with a fragrant ghee tadka. It’s comfort in a bowl!\n\n2. Bhuga Chawal\nThis aromatic rice dish is cooked with caramelized onions, warming spices, and green chillies for a subtly spicy, earthy base that perfectly complements the kadhi.\n\n3. Arbi Tuk\nCrispy outside, soft inside—these smashed colocasia discs are fried, spiced with turmeric, chilli, and amchur, and shallow-cooked for maximum flavour and crunch.\n\nWhile these may seem like familiar names, what I’m sharing today is my personal take on the Sindhi Thali - with tips, techniques, and love passed down from dear friends and home-kitchen wisdom.\n\nIngredients Used\n👉 Sindhi Kadhi\nGhee – 4 tbsp\nMustard Seeds – 1 tsp\nCumin Seeds – 1 tsp\nFenugreek Seeds – ½–1 tsp\nCrushed Coriander Seeds – 1 tbsp\nCurry Leaves – 1 sprig\nGram Flour (Besan) – 1½ cups\nTomatoes (boiled & puréed) – 5\nRed Chilli Powder – 1 tbsp\nCoriander Powder – 1 tbsp\nWater – ½ litre\nVegetables: Carrot, Drumstick, Potato, Brinjal, Cluster Beans – 100g each\nOkra (Bhindi) – 100g (lightly sautéed in ghee)\nTamarind Pulp – 2 tbsp\nSalt – to taste\n\n👉 Bhuga Chawal\nGhee – 3 tbsp\nBay Leaves – 2\nCinnamon – 1 inch\nGreen Cardamoms – 3\nCloves – 3\nBlack Peppercorns – 10\nSliced Onions – 3\nRed Chilli Powder – ½ tsp\nGreen Chillies – 3 slit\nBasmati Rice (soaked) – 2 cups\nSalt – 1½ tsp\nWater – 4 cups\nTadka for Bhuga Chawal:\nGhee – 1 tbsp\nMethi – ¼ tsp\nMustard Seeds – ½ tsp\nCumin Seeds – ½ tsp\nCurry Leaves – a sprig\n\n👉 Arbi Tuk\nArbi (Colocasia) – ½ kg (boiled, peeled)\nOil – for frying\nTurmeric Powder – ¾ tsp\nRed Chilli Powder – 1 tbsp\nRaw Mango Powder (Amchur) – 1 tbsp\nSalt – to taste\nOil – for pan-frying\n\n\nStep-by-Step Cooking Instructions\nSindhi Kadhi\n- In ghee, splutter mustard, cumin, methi, crushed coriander, and curry leaves.\n- Add gram flour and roast on low until aromatic.\n- Stir in tomato purée and spices.\n- Gradually add water and vegetables (except bhindi).\n- Fry bhindi separately and add once veggies are partly cooked.\n- Add tamarind pulp, cook till everything is tender.\n- Finish with a separate ghee tadka for extra flavour and aroma.\n\nBhuga Chawal\n- Heat ghee, add whole spices, then sliced onions.\n- Cook onions till golden brown.\n- Add soaked rice, salt, red chilli powder, green chillies.\n- Add water, cover and cook till done.\n- Fluff the rice and give a final tempering if desired.\n\nArbi Tuk\n- Boil, peel, and deep-fry arbi till golden.\n- Gently smash them and toss with dry spices.\n- Pan-fry with a drizzle of oil till crisp on both sides.\n\nThis Sindhi-style vegetarian thali is not just delicious - it’s also deeply rooted in tradition, loaded with fibre and plant protein, and perfect for festive as well as everyday meals. Whether you're a fan of regional Indian food or exploring authentic Sindhi cuisine, this recipe is a must-try.\n\n___________________________________________\n\nSindhi thali recipe | Sindhi kadhi recipe | Bhuga chawal recipe | Arbi tuk recipe | Sindhi food | vegetarian Indian thali | traditional Indian lunch | gram flour curry | Smita Deo recipes | comfort food India | regional thali India | how to make Sindhi kadhi at home\n___________________________________________\n\nDon’t forget to LIKE, COMMENT, and SUBSCRIBE to the channel for more soulful Indian recipes!\n\n#SindhiThali #SmitaDeo #sindhikadhi  #BhugaChawal #ArbiTuk #IndianThaliRecipes #VegetarianIndianThali #traditionalindianfood  #homecookedwithlove  #SmitaDeoRecipes	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkLEWtsmnJA	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AkLEWtsmnJA/hqdefault.jpg	youtube	scraped	UC2JiOaDae2GysL-_mSL7pwQ	Smita Deo	2025-06-16 13:12:40	15672	503		801	t

buDQpK7FytE	Trump says Iran “not winning war” as Israel hits state TV complex and multiple targets | BBC News	Israel has carried out more destructive air strikes across Iran including on the capital Tehran.  Iran’s state media complex was destroyed, with the blast captured on live TV.    Iran condemned the attack as a war crime.   Many people are trying to flee Teheran.   Other military and civil sites Iran have again been hit, with Israel claiming it has air control over the capital.

99Em1oQwQlo	Spinosaurus & Nguma Monene: The Evolution of a Cryptid | Dinosaur Documentary	Among the giants of prehistory, one stands out—not for being the heaviest, but for being the longest. Spinosaurus aegyptiacus, a massive predator from the Cretaceous period, that stretched over 15 meters (50 feet) from snout to tail, surpassing even the mighty Tyrannosaurus rex and Giganotosaurus in sheer length. With its elongated skull, crocodilian teeth, towering sail, and a unique tail, Spinosaurus was unlike any other theropod.\n\nYet, what if Spinosaurus never truly vanished? What if, deep in the unexplored jungles of Africa, something remarkably similar still lurks in the shadows? This brings us to the legend of Nguma Monene, a cryptid featured in our comic book series CONGO 1880 — a creature that might just be the Spinosaurus that time forgot.\n\nGet the CONGO 1880 comic books: https://shop.mudnag.com/products/congo-1880-1\nDownload: https://mudnag.com/#digital\n\nAll things CONGO 1880: https://linktr.ee/congo.bd\nJoin our Discord sever: https://discord.gg/mbYbtpTGjW\nMudnag store: https://shop.mudnag.com\n\nSubscribe for more videos like this one.\n\nSocial links:\n- Instagram: https://instagram.com/congo.bd\n- Facebook: https://facebook.com/congobd\n- TikTok: https://tiktok.com/@congo.bd\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/CongoComics\n- YouTube: https://youtube.com/@Mudnag\n\nSpecial thanks to our patrons and FB members:\n- Alex Merguie\n- Carla Marina Silva\n- David Glenn\n- Sam Allred\n- Steve Bradshaw\n- Todd Hunter\n- Tyler Swonger\n\nJoin: https://www.patreon.com/Mudnag\n\n---------~---------\nCredits\n\nResearch and Host:\n- Henrique Gandum\n\nFilming, Editing and VFX:\n- Duarte Gandum\n\nMusic:\n- @Archaeoptracks\n- Chance Thomas\n- @otaiza_jl\n---------~---------\n\nFilm Gear:\n- Fuji X-H2S: https://amzn.to/3HRBCM7\n- DJI Mic: https://amzn.to/41QeXef\n- Smallrig Tripod: https://amzn.to/3DUEwhF\n- Manfrotto Head: https://amzn.to/42py0MG\n- Sennheiser MKE 600: https://amzn.to/4068pDW\n- Canon 28-105 F3.5-4.5: https://amzn.to/3GHfwvM\n- Neewer Lights: https://amzn.to/3mrpUkG\n\nOutro music:\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoRJC_h97lk\n\n0:00 Spinosaurus\n0:49 Nguma Monene\n1:32 Science and myth\n2:09 Speculation\n3:17 Reports of a creature\n3:55 Defying what we know\n4:39 Evolution\n5:37 The year of Spinosaurus\n6:12 A great dinosaur\n6:27 Share your feedback\n6:36 Outro\n\nNo generative AI imagery was used in this video.\n\nhttps://mudnag.com	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99Em1oQwQlo	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/99Em1oQwQlo/hqdefault.jpg	youtube	scraped	UCGkkwB94KaS7DYc0ksmtyBA	Mudnag	2025-06-14 22:30:06	14766	641	Congo, Congobd, mokele mbembe, sauropod, cryptid, cryptozoology, congo cryptids, graphic novel, comic books, comics, dinosaurs, dinosaur short film, congo books, insight, likouala, animation, Mudnag, kasai rex, t-rex, tyrannosaurus rex, abelisaur, prehistoric planet, disney dinosaur, jurassic park, carnotaurus, sighting, cgi, vfx, caught on camera, analog horror, horror, documentary, real, myth, legend, truth, adventure, africa, neo, dino, walking with dinosaurs, wwd, bbc, spinosaurus, aegypticus, nguma monene	415	t

iRYZjOuUnlU	The Israel-Palestine conflict: a brief, simple history	The conflict is really only 100 years old.\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nOne of the biggest myths about the Israel-Palestine conflict is that it's been going on for centuries, that this is all about ancient religious hatreds.\n\nIn fact, while religion is involved, the conflict is mostly about two groups of people who claim the same land. And it really only goes back about a century, to the early 1900s. At its heart, it is a conflict between two self-determination movements — the Jewish Zionist project and the Palestinian nationalist project — that lay claim to the same territory.\n\nRead more about the Israel-Palestine conflict on Vox: http://bit.ly/2S7gFlT\n\nYour basic questions about Israel and Palestine answered:\n\n– What are Israel and Palestine? Why are they fighting? http://bit.ly/2NKJPcd\n– What is Zionism? http://bit.ly/2G549P6\n– How did Israel become a country in the first place? http://bit.ly/2xFdAjN\n– What are settlements, and why are they such a big deal? http://bit.ly/30pSRfZ\n– What were the intifadas? http://bit.ly/2NInMm9\n– How does the world feel about Israel/Palestine? http://bit.ly/2JprIEh\n– What is the Israeli-Palestinian peace process? http://bit.ly/2XIRzQB\n\nFurther reading on the Israel-Palestine conflict: http://bit.ly/2XBrIFf\n\nYou can also watch our three-part documentary series on Israeli settlements from 2016.

Struck at night. And vanished without a trace.\nThis is not fiction — this is the real story of Britain’s most ruthless ATM robbery gang, a crew that tore through over 40 towns across the UK, outsmarting five police forces and leaving behind nothing but broken glass and charred getaway vehicles. What started as a mysterious van creeping through the quiet streets of Nottinghamshire turned into one of the most shocking and coordinated heist operations in modern British history.\n\nWelcome to a gripping UK crime documentary that digs deep into the British criminal underworld — exploring how three men, supported by a tight network of family and insiders, executed hit after hit with military-level precision. This isn’t just a UK crime gangs documentary, it’s an exploration of how British organised crime operates under the radar — quiet, methodical, and terrifyingly effective.\n\n⏱️ Timestamps \n00:00 - Intro to one of a True Crime Stories\n01:10 - The Core Trio in UK Organised Crime\n03:49 - The Network of this Organized Crime Explained\n05:55 - The Tactics use in this Street Crime UK\n07:57 - True Crime Stories Scotland Reach\n09:30 - The Breakthrough in UK Crime Investigation\n12:03 - The Arrest of Real Criminals\n14:35 - The Courtroom for these UK Criminal Gangs\n16:48 - Sentencing to Counter British Street Crime \n\n🎥 In this true crime documentary, we peel back the layers of a nationwide operation that used cloned vans, burner phones, stolen vehicles, and strategic planning to commit a wave of heists across the country — from Nottingham to Edinburgh, Wolverhampton to Peterborough. For months, they left behind no evidence, no witnesses, and no tracks. Until one tiny mistake cracked it all wide open.\n\nIf you're into real UK crime stories, true crime stories Britain, or fascinated by the inner workings of organized crime explained, this story will leave you stunned. We explore the blurred lines between UK street crime and sophisticated criminal enterprise — how loyalty, family ties, and silence kept this gang alive for 19 relentless months.\n\n🌍 Featuring insight into Nottingham crime documentary territory, we follow the investigative timeline — from CCTV footage that led nowhere to the forensic breakthroughs that slowly closed in on the crew. If you're following Nottingham crime news or want a Nottingham true crime case that shook entire communities, this is it.\n\nThis isn’t just about money stolen — it’s about communities hit, law enforcement tested, and the fine line between order and chaos in Britain’s shadowy corners. From British crime gangs to UK criminal underworld dynamics, this case reveals how UK crime lords and gang leaders structure their empires beneath the surface of everyday life.\n\nIf you're drawn to UK crime documentary real stories that pull you deep into the heart of Britain's criminal underworld, this video delivers a gripping account you won’t forget. It’s more than just headlines and mugshots — it’s a layered, atmospheric dive into how a small group of individuals outwitted authorities, shattered quiet communities, and pulled off one of the most calculated heist sprees the UK has seen in years.\n\nThis is British crime documentary content that feels raw and unfiltered — not dramatised or glossed over, but told with the kind of detail and grit that puts you right in the scene. From the eerie stillness of midnight raids to the silent coordination of a network that operated across more than 40 towns, every moment is grounded in real facts, real people, and real consequences.\n\nAnd if you’re constantly searching for the best true crime stories on YouTube, this one checks every box: a mystery that slowly unravels, a cast of characters hiding in plain sight, and an ending that finally brings justice to the surface. Whether you're a long-time fan of British true crime or new to this world, this documentary has all the marks of a standout story.\n...this episode will leave you hooked.\n\n🔎 If you're into UK true crime cases, British crime families, or want to know how UK gang street life works in real life — stay tuned. This is the kind of true crime story that makes you rethink what happens on those quiet streets at 3AM.\n\n💬 Let us know your thoughts in the comments — were the sentences enough for what they did?

And so is a new hole in my wallet. It boasts a stunning HDR screen, premium build, and significant performance leap with double the CPU cores, triple the RAM, and ten times the graphics - if you can believe Nvidia. While "miracle ports" shine and upgraded games look great, Joy-Cons still drift. The $80 game price and LCD screen are drawbacks, but the 120Hz refresh rate and potential for remote gaming are exciting.

x1RvdPXZbck	Denza B5 2026 review: BYD's new hybrid 4WD targets Toyota Prado! | Fangchengbao Leopard Boa 5 tested	It's known in its Chinese domestic market as the Fangchengbao Leopard Boa 5, but in Australia it'll likely be called the 2026 Denza B5. Either way, this new four-wheel-drive (4WD) has its proverbial sights set on the new Toyota LandCruiser Prado 250 Series, and it will do so with a more potent version of the related BYD Shark 6 dual pick-up's plug-in hybrid powertrain.\n\nYep, the B5 is firming as one of the first models Down Under for the Denza brand, which is a premium spin-off of BYD – similar to Lexus' relationship with Toyota. But the big news is what is under the new 4WD's bonnet: a 145kW 1.5-litre turbocharged four-cylinder petrol engine that's paired with two permanent magnet synchronous electric motors, making combined power and torque outputs of 505kW and 760Nm. Big numbers.\n\nIn this expert review, CarsGuide Managing Editor Tim Nicholson travels to China to get an early taste of the B5 ahead of its potential Australian release date.\n\n#Denza #B5 #Review\n--\nTimecodes:\n00:00 Intro\n00:34 Design\n01:43 Practicality\n04:53 Under the bonnet\n05:35 Efficiency\n05:55 Driving\n06:28 Verdict\n\n--\nRead Tim's full review: https://bit.ly/4l31hDp\nCheck out our Denza B5 hub: https://bit.ly/3SMBmE3\nFind more SUVs: https://bit.ly/3QVs1X1\nVisit our EVGuide: https://bit.ly/3UHO9GT\n--\nCarsGuide - Go beyond the test drive\nVisit our website for News, Reviews, Advice and more: https://www.carsguide.com.au\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/carsguide\nLike our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/carsguide.australia\nFollow our TikTok profile: https://www.tiktok.com/@carsguide.com.au\nFollow our Instagram profile: https://www.instagram.com/carsguideaus\nFollow our X profile: https://www.x.com/CarsGuide\nFollow our Threads profile: https://www.threads.net/@carsguideaus\nFollow our LinkedIn page: https://www.linkedin.com/company/carsguide-com-au	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1RvdPXZbck	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x1RvdPXZbck/hqdefault.jpg	youtube	scraped	UClyTiw88hGahmbsRtqDQxSA	CarsGuide	2025-06-14 13:31:04	21552	193	CarsGuide, CarsGuide.com.au, BYD, Denza B5, Denza, SUV, Off Road, Off Road SUV, Family, Family Car, Family SUV, FangChenBao, Fangchengbao Leopard Bao 5	423	t

stEgjUB4Ryc	Trump’s New Travel Ban: Full and Partial Entry Restrictions on 19 Countries | ISH News	On June 4, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump signed a new travel ban affecting 19 countries, set to begin on June 9. The ban blocks or limits various visa types like tourist, student, and business visas. Twelve countries face full restrictions, while seven face partial ones. The government says the ban is for national security, especially after a recent terror attack. Exceptions include green card holders, diplomats, and special visa cases. The decision has received mixed reactions, supporters call it necessary for safety, while critics say it’s unfair and discriminatory. The list of banned countries may change based on security conditions.\n\n#DonaldTrump #TravelBan #USImmigration #VisaBan #NationalSecurity #BannedCountries #ImmigrationPolicy #VisaRestrictions #HumanRights #USNews #GlobalPolitics \n\nISH News broadcasts the Daily News and Entertainment online in Deaf-friendly accessible formats which are in Indian Sign Language (ISL), visual images with titles, voice-over and closed-captions.

CYxm_d_M50Y	THUNDERBIRDS UNSEEN: Launching Thunderbird 2 (Behind The Scenes Documentary)	The unforgettable sight of palm trees moving aside to allow Thunderbird 2 to make its way towards its launch ramp has remained in the minds of viewers for six decades. Now, with previously unseen film material, behind the scenes stills, and archive research – this extra instalment of our behind the scenes investigation, Thunderbirds Unseen, sheds new light on of the creation of this well-loved scene from Gerry and Sylvia Anderson's classic television series.\n\nThunderbirds was a massive success upon its debut in 1965 and this documentary programme investigates contributions made by scriptwriters, directors, special effects technicians, composer Barry Gray, and more. To help us along the way, we will be drawing on not just interviews with the cast and crew, but from surviving material ranging from surviving scripts and musical scores, to original rushes material digitised for the first time in 4k! \n\nExplore this classic Supermarionation show like never before...	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYxm_d_M50Y	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CYxm_d_M50Y/hqdefault.jpg	youtube	scraped	UCMQv_O7i_iXMFBSbtolnpjA	Century 21 Films	2025-06-16 00:07:55	10567	431	The Thunder Birds, The Thunderbirds, Jerry Anderson, Superanimation, Super Marion Nation, doc, bts, makingof, lost media	1043	t
